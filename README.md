# MultiThreaded-SudokuSolver

This project focuses on the development of a Multi-Threaded Sudoku Solver capable of solving a valid NxN Sudoku puzzle efficiently. The solver takes advantage of parallelism by implementing multi-threading using pthreads in the C programming language.

## Features

- **Multi-Threaded Approach:** The Sudoku Solver utilizes multi-threading to solve the puzzle. When encountering an empty cell, the program spawns 'N' threads based on the input, allowing multiple threads to work concurrently and improve the solving speed.

- **Efficient Solution:** By leveraging the power of multi-threading, the solver aims to provide an efficient solution to Sudoku puzzles. The use of multiple threads enables faster exploration of possible solutions and improves overall performance.

- **Class Leaderboard Performance:** The solver has been tested by submitting the code to a server for evaluation in terms of speed and correctness. It achieved an impressive runtime of approximately '0' seconds, placing the project among the top 10 on the class leaderboard.

## Performance

The MultiThreaded-SudokuSolver has demonstrated exceptional performance by achieving an impressive runtime of approximately '0' seconds when evaluated on a class server. The solver's efficient multi-threaded approach allows for quick and accurate solutions to Sudoku puzzles of varying complexities.
